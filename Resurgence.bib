	abstract = {In a wide range of quantum theoretical settings -- from quantum mechanics to quantum field theory, from gauge theory to string theory -- singularities in the complex Borel plane, usually associated to instantons or renormalons, render perturbation theory ill-defined as they give rise to nonperturbative ambiguities. These ambiguities are associated to choices of an integration contour in the resummation of perturbation theory, along (singular) Stokes directions in the complex Borel plane (rendering perturbative expansions non-Borel summable along any Stokes line). More recently, it has been shown that the proper framework to address these issues is that of resurgent analysis and transseries. In this context, the cancelation of all nonperturbative ambiguities is shown to be a consequence of choosing the transseries median resummation as the appropriate family of unambiguous real solutions along the coupling-constant real axis. While the median resummation is easily implemented for one-parameter transseries, once one considers more general multi-parameter transseries the procedure becomes highly dependent upon properly understanding Stokes transitions in the complex Borel plane. In particular, all Stokes coefficients must now be known in order to explicitly implement multi-parameter median resummations. In the cases where quantum-theoretical physical observables are described by resurgent functions and transseries, the methods described herein show how one may cancel nonperturbative ambiguities, and define these observables nonperturbatively starting out from perturbation theory. Along the way, structural results concerning resurgent transseries are also obtained.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5922},
	abstract = {Nonperturbative effects in string theory are usually associated to D-branes. In many cases it can be explicitly shown that D-brane instantons control the large-order behavior of string perturbation theory, leading to the well-known (2g)! growth of the genus expansion. This paper presents a detailed treatment of nonperturbative solutions in string theory, and their relation to the large-order behavior of perturbation theory, making use of transseries and resurgent analysis. These are powerful techniques addressing general nonperturbative contributions within non-linear systems, which are developed at length herein as they apply to string theory. The cases of topological strings, the Painleve I equation describing 2d quantum gravity, and the quartic matrix model, are explicitly addressed. These results generalize to minimal strings and general matrix models. It is shown that, in order to completely understand string theory at a fully nonperturbative level, new sectors are required beyond the standard D-brane sector.},

	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monomial&oldid=937166984},
	abstract = {In mathematics, a monomial is, roughly speaking, a polynomial which has only one term. Two definitions of a monomial may be encountered:

(1): A monomial, also called power product, is a product of powers of variables with nonnegative integer exponents, or, in other words, a product of variables, possibly with repetitions. The constant 1 is a monomial, being equal to the empty product and x0 for any variable x. If only a single variable x is considered, this means that a monomial is either 1 or a power xn of x, with n a positive integer. If several variables are considered, say, 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
        y
        ,
        z
        ,
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle x,y,z,\}
   then each can be given an exponent, so that any monomial is of the form 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            a
          
        
        
          y
          
            b
          
        
        
          z
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle x{\textasciicircum}\{a\}y{\textasciicircum}\{b\}z{\textasciicircum}\{c\}\}
   with 
  
    
      
        a
        ,
        b
        ,
        c
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle a,b,c\}
   non-negative integers (taking note that any exponent 0 makes the corresponding factor equal to 1).
(2): A monomial is a monomial in the first sense multiplied by a nonzero constant, called the coefficient of the monomial. A monomial in the first sense is a special case of a monomial in the second sense, where the coefficient is 1. For example, in this interpretation 
  
    
      
        −
        7
        
          x
          
            5
          
        
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle -7x{\textasciicircum}\{5\}\}
   and 
  
    
      
        (
        3
        −
        4
        i
        )
        
          x
          
            4
          
        
        y
        
          z
          
            13
          
        
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle (3-4i)x{\textasciicircum}\{4\}yz{\textasciicircum}\{13\}\}
   are monomials (in the second example, the variables are 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
        y
        ,
        z
        ,
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle x,y,z,\}
   and the coefficient is a complex number).In the context of Laurent polynomials and Laurent series, the exponents of a monomial may be negative, and in the context of Puiseux series, the exponents may be rational numbers.
Since the word "monomial", as well as the word "polynomial", comes from the late Latin word "binomium" (binomial), by changing the prefix "bi" (two in Latin), a monomial should theoretically be called a "mononomial". "Monomial" is a syncope by haplology of "mononomial".},

	title = {Introduction to 1-summability and resurgence},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0356},
	abstract = {This text is about the mathematical use of certain divergent power series. The first part is an introduction to 1-summability. The definitions rely on the formal Borel transform and the Laplace transform along an arbitrary direction of the complex plane. Given an arc of directions, if a power series is 1-summable in that arc, then one can attach to it a Borel-Laplace sum, i.e. a holomorphic function defined in a large enough sector and asymptotic to that power series in Gevrey sense. The second part is an introduction to Ecalle's resurgence theory. A power series is said to be resurgent when its Borel transform is convergent and has good analytic continuation properties: there may be singularities but they must be isolated. The analysis of these singularities, through the so-called alien calculus, allows one to compare the various Borel-Laplace sums attached to the same resurgent 1-summable series.In the context of analytic difference-or-differential equations, this sheds light on the Stokes phenomenon. A few elementary or classical examples are given a thorough treatment (the Euler series, the Stirling series, a less known example by Poincar{\textbackslash}'e). Special attention is devoted to non-linear operations: 1-summable series as well as resurgent series are shown to form algebras which are stable by composition. As an application, the resurgent approach to the classification of tangent-to-identity germs of holomorphic diffeomorphisms in the simplest case is included. An example of a class of non-linear differential equations giving rise to resurgent solutions is also presented. The exposition is as self-contained as can be, requiring only some familiarity with holomorphic functions of one complex variable.},

	abstract = {This is an introductory level review of recent applications of resurgent trans-series and Picard-Lefschetz theory to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. Resurgence connects local perturbative data with global topological structure. In quantum mechanical systems, this program provides a constructive relation between different saddles. For example, in certain cases it has been shown that all information around the instanton saddle is encoded in perturbation theory around the perturbative saddle. In quantum field theory, such as sigma models compactified on a circle, neutral bions provide a semi-classical interpretation of the elusive IR-renormalon, and fractional kink instantons lead to the non-perturbatively induced gap, of order of the strong scale. In the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, saddles must be found by solving the holomorphic Newton's equation in the inverted (holomorphized) potential. Some saddles are complex, multi-valued, and even singular, but of finite action, and their inclusion is strictly necessary to prevent inconsistencies. The multi-valued saddles enter either via resurgent cancellations, or their phase is tied with a hidden topological angle. We emphasize the importance of the destructive/constructive interference effects between equally dominant saddles in the Lefschetz thimble decomposition. This is especially important in the context of the sign problem.},

We define the Stokes automorphism and the alien derivative and discuss these objects in concrete examples using the notion of trans-series expansion. With all the tools introduced, we see how resurgence and alien calculus allow us to extract non-perturbative physics from perturbation theory.

We have two hopes concerning the BenderWu package. One is that due to resurgence, large amount of non-perturbative information, such as non-perturbative energies and wave-functions (e.g. WKB wave functions), can in principle be extracted from the perturbative data. We also hope that the package may be used as a teaching tool, providing an effective bridge between perturbation theory and non-perturbative physics in textbooks. Finally, we show that for the multi-variable case, the recursion relation acquires a geometric character, and has a structure which allows easy parallelization to computer clusters.},

This sequence of approximate solutions is apparently well-behaved and numerically simple to calculate since it only requires the evaluation of (nested) one-loop integrals. To test this resummation scheme, the case of \${\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}4\$ theory in 1+1 dimensions is considered, finding approximate agreement with known results for the vacuum energy and mass gap up to the critical point. Because it can be generalized to other dimensions, fermionic fields and finite temperature, the resummation scheme could potentially become a useful tool for calculating non-perturbative properties approximately in certain quantum field theories.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10441},
	abstract = {The computation of observables in general interacting theories, be them quantum mechanical, field, gauge or string theories, is a non-trivial problem which in many cases can only be addressed by resorting to perturbative methods. In most physically interesting problems these perturbative expansions result in asymptotic series with zero radius of convergence. These asymptotic series then require the use of resurgence and transseries in order for the associated observables to become nonperturbatively well-defined. Resurgence encodes the complete large-order asymptotic behaviour of the coefficients from a perturbative expansion, generically in terms of (multi) instanton sectors and for each problem in terms of its Stokes constants. Some observables arise from linear problems, and have a finite number of instanton sectors and associated Stokes constants; some other observables arise from nonlinear problems, and have an infinite number of instanton sectors and Stokes constants. By means of two very explicit examples, and with emphasis on a pedagogical style of presentation, this work aims at serving as a primer on the aforementioned resurgent, large-order asymptotics of general perturbative expansions. This includes discussions of transseries, Stokes phenomena, generalized steepest-descent methods, Borel transforms, nonlinear resonance, and alien calculus. Furthermore, resurgent properties of transseries---usually described mathematically via alien calculus---are recast in equivalent physical languages: either a "statistical mechanical" language, as motions in chains and lattices; or a "conformal field theoretical" language, with underlying Virasoro-like algebraic structures.},

The objective of this book is to teaching the insights and problem-solving skills that are most useful in solving mathematical problems arising in the course of modern research. Intended for graduate students and advanced undergraduates, the book assumes only a limited familiarity with differential equations and complex variables. The presentation begins with a review of differential and difference equations; develops local asymptotic methods for differential and difference equations; explains perturbation and summation theory; and concludes with a an exposition of global asymptotic methods, including boundary-layer theory, WKB theory, and multiple-scale analysis. Emphasizing applications, the discussion stresses care rather than rigor and relies on many well-chosen examples to teach the reader how an applied mathematician tackles problems. There are 190 computer-generated plots and tables comparing approximate and exact solutions; over 600 problems, of varying levels of difficulty; and an appendix summarizing the properties of special functions.},

This model is interesting because the perturbation series for the ground-state energy diverges. To investigate the reason for this divergence, we analytically continue the energy levels of the Hamiltonian H into the complex λ plane. Using WKB techniques, we find that the energy levels as a function of λ, or more generally of λα, have an infinite number of branch points with a limit point at λ=0. Thus, the origin is not an isolated singularity. Level crossing occurs at each branch point. If we choose α=13, the resolvent (z−H)−1 has no branch cut. However, for all z it has an infinite sequence of poles which have a limit point at the origin. The anharmonic oscillator is of particular interest to field theoreticians because it is a model of λϕ4 field theory in one-dimensional space-time. The unusual and unexpected properties exhibited by this model may give some indication of the analytic structure of a more realistic field theory.},
